The third person pov is buggy. I was able to fix the movement controls though, before it would walk in different directions than the specified input keys. The camera is controls are the main thing that makes it feel weird now. I also wasn't able to sucessfully make the character hold on to the gun and it would only float instead. I just brought it back some so it would still be able to aim well.
The first person pov works well though. 
One of the main problems I ran into was trying to get the bullet collisions to work against the ai. I did fix this issue though.
One of the other main issues I faced was trying to get the animations to work for everything. I wasn't able to completely fix the AI animations, but they were improved.

Known Bug: the weapon's barrel flashes are pink rather than yellowish.
